\section{Questions}

 1. I visited Petersburg, AK and went crabbing for some fresh seafood. I also went whitewater rafting down in Riggins, ID. I also made several wood projects. I also took 14 credits over the summer to include CS 120, so I'm somewhat familiar with coding concepts.
 
 2. I want to learn Python as compared to C++. Other then that I'm not sure what to expect or get into.
